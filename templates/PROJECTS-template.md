# Projects

<!-- ============================================================
  PROJECTS.md — Project Registry
  ============================================================

  FORMAT: One ## block per project. The slug (## heading text)
  is the canonical project ID used in task IDs, file names,
  and SQLite foreign keys. Keep it lowercase and hyphenated.

  FIELDS:
    Name        Human-readable display name (any capitalization).
    Status      One of: active | paused | done
    Description One-sentence summary of the project's purpose.

  FILE CONVENTIONS:
    Task file:  tasks/<slug>-tasks.md   (required)
    Plan file:  plans/<slug>-plan.md    (optional)

  NOTE: Do not add task counts or progress bars here. Those are
  computed by the sync/export scripts and belong in dashboards,
  not in this registry file.
